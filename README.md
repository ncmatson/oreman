## Vision/RF Datset
This work includes a new dataset consisting of 2.5D images of various (urban, residential, rural) environments paired with the REM for multiple user locations within each environment.  The dataset used in the paper will be available soon.  To generate the dataset for different locations or different parameters use the code available in [datasets](./dataset/dataset.md)
Coming soon...
